# Jewelcase web client

The responsive web app: Svelte 5 + TypeScript on SvelteKit in SPA mode (`design/general.md` §1, §7.1).

## Running it

The client talks only to the public API (`api/openapi.yaml`). Until the Rust server implements
that API, `vite dev` and `vite preview` answer `/api/v1` with a **mock** (`mock/`) that reads the
database the real scanner writes. So you first scan a music folder with the server, then run the
client.

```sh
# 1. Scan once from the repository root. Leave it running if you want waveforms and loudness: analysis
#    runs in the background and starts about 30 seconds after launch.
JEWELCASE_MUSIC=/path/to/music JEWELCASE_DATA_DIR=./data cargo run -p jewelcase-server

# 2. In another terminal, start the client.
cd web
pnpm install
pnpm dev            # http://localhost:5173
```

The mock reads `$JEWELCASE_DATA_DIR/state/jewelcase.db`, with `JEWELCASE_DATA_DIR` defaulting to
the repository's `data/`. The server defaults to `/data`, the path inside its container, so step 1
sets it. With no database the mock serves an empty server, and the client shows its "No music yet"
state.

## Scripts

| Command                       | What it does                                                   |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pnpm dev`                    | Dev server with the mock API                                   |
| `pnpm build` / `pnpm preview` | Static production build in `build/`, and a local preview of it |
| `pnpm check`                  | Type-check, including the mock                                 |
| `pnpm lint` / `pnpm format`   | ESLint and oxfmt                                               |
| `pnpm test:unit`              | Vitest, in Node and in a headless browser                      |
| `pnpm test:e2e`               | Playwright, against `preview`, with fixture data               |
| `pnpm gen:api`                | Regenerate `src/lib/api/schema.d.ts` from `api/openapi.yaml`   |

API types are generated, never hand-written. After editing the OpenAPI spec, run `pnpm gen:api`
and commit the result.

| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `src/lib/api/`             | Generated schema types, the aliases in use, and the typed client. Catalog reads move to the worker later, and this is the one module that changes then. |
| `src/lib/player.svelte.ts` | Playback: one audio element, the play context, and Media Session                                                                                        |
| `src/lib/queue.ts`         | Moving through a context: next/previous and skipping missing tracks                                                                                     |
| `src/lib/components/`      | Shell (sidebar, tab bar, player), collection and track views, waveform                                                                                  |
| `src/routes/`              | One route per view: `/albums`, `/albums/[id]`, `/artists/…`, `/playlists/…`, `/songs`, `/search`                                                        |
| `mock/`                    | The dev-only mock API. Never bundled into the client.                                                                                                   |

## What the mock does not do

It is a stand-in for the server, so it has these limits. None of them are client behaviour.

- **Search** is a case-insensitive substring match, not the real typo-tolerant search.
- **Audio** is always the original file with no transcoding, so formats the browser can't decode
  (AIFF in Chrome, for example) are skipped.
- **Playlists** are generated from the library and read-only; there is no playlist storage yet.
- **Personal data** (play counts, listening history) doesn't exist, so sorts that need it fall back
  to album or name order.
- Only the read endpoints the client uses are implemented; any write answers `405`.

## Not built yet

These are client work still to do: virtualized lists (long lists currently page in as you scroll),
the queue panel, loudness normalization, offline, and account preferences. Grid/list view and
theme are per-browser for now.
